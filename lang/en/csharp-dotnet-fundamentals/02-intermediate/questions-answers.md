## Q1. Explain different COMJIT / compilation modes in .NET and what changes occurred over time.

**Question:**  
What are the different JIT / compilation modes (e.g. Pre-JIT, Tiered JIT, ReadyToRun) in .NET? How have they evolved and what trade-offs/changes were introduced?

**Answer:**  
.NET has evolved its compilation strategies over time to balance **startup time** and **steady-state performance**. Some key modes and changes:

- **Pre-JIT / Ahead-of-Time (AOT) / ReadyToRun**: compile IL to native beforehand so less work at runtime. Helps startup but can produce less-optimized code. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Tiered JIT Compilation** (enabled by default since .NET Core 3.0):  
  1. **Tier 0** (Quick JIT): compile quickly with minimal optimizations for fast startup. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
  2. **Tier 1** (Optimized JIT): if a method is “hot” (called often), recompile it in background with full optimizations. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **ReadyToRun + Tiered JIT interaction**: code may start from precompiled ReadyToRun, then get re-jitted by Tiered JIT for better performance. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Quick JIT settings**: methods without loops can be compiled faster (less optimization) under Quick JIT; trade-off is possible lower performance. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

**Advantages / Changes Over Time**  
- Startup time improved by reducing heavy JIT work initially.  
- Long-running methods get optimized later, combining fast startup with high performance.  
- Precompiled code (ReadyToRun) reduces JIT overhead but may be less optimized for specific hardware.  
- Greater flexibility: .NET allows configuration of these behaviors (enable/disable tiered, quick JIT) via runtime settings. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  


## Q2. What is AOT (Ahead-Of-Time compilation) in .NET?

**Question:**  
What is **AOT (Ahead-Of-Time compilation)** in .NET, and how does it differ from JIT?

**Answer:**  
- **AOT (Ahead-Of-Time compilation)** means converting **IL code directly into native machine code at build or publish time**, instead of waiting for JIT to do it at runtime.  
- In .NET, this is used to improve **startup performance**, reduce **runtime overhead**, and sometimes make apps smaller or easier to deploy.  
- AOT is especially important in environments where JIT is restricted (e.g., iOS, Blazor WebAssembly).  

**AOT in .NET:**  
- **ReadyToRun (R2R):** partial AOT → compiles IL to native at publish, but can still fall back to JIT.  
- **Full Native AOT (since .NET 7+):** compiles the whole app to native code → no JIT at runtime.  
- **Mono AOT:** used in Xamarin/MAUI, Blazor WebAssembly → compiles IL to native WASM or platform-specific code.  

**Advantages:**  
- Faster startup (no JIT on first call).  
- Works in restricted environments (no JIT allowed).  
- Can reduce memory usage in some cases.  

**Trade-offs:**  
- Larger binaries (contains precompiled machine code).  
- Less dynamic optimizations compared to Tiered JIT.  
- Longer publish/build time.  

**Example — publishing with ReadyToRun:**
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishReadyToRun=true
//Example — publishing with Native AOT (since .NET 7):
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishAot=true
```
