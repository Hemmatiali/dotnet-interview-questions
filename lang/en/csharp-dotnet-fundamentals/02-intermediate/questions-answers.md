## Q1. Explain different COMJIT / compilation modes in .NET and what changes occurred over time.

**Question:**  
What are the different JIT / compilation modes (e.g. Pre-JIT, Tiered JIT, ReadyToRun) in .NET? How have they evolved and what trade-offs/changes were introduced?

**Answer:**  
.NET has evolved its compilation strategies over time to balance **startup time** and **steady-state performance**. Some key modes and changes:

- **Pre-JIT / Ahead-of-Time (AOT) / ReadyToRun**: compile IL to native beforehand so less work at runtime. Helps startup but can produce less-optimized code. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Tiered JIT Compilation** (enabled by default since .NET Core 3.0):  
  1. **Tier 0** (Quick JIT): compile quickly with minimal optimizations for fast startup. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
  2. **Tier 1** (Optimized JIT): if a method is “hot” (called often), recompile it in background with full optimizations. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **ReadyToRun + Tiered JIT interaction**: code may start from precompiled ReadyToRun, then get re-jitted by Tiered JIT for better performance. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Quick JIT settings**: methods without loops can be compiled faster (less optimization) under Quick JIT; trade-off is possible lower performance. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

**Advantages / Changes Over Time**  
- Startup time improved by reducing heavy JIT work initially.  
- Long-running methods get optimized later, combining fast startup with high performance.  
- Precompiled code (ReadyToRun) reduces JIT overhead but may be less optimized for specific hardware.  
- Greater flexibility: .NET allows configuration of these behaviors (enable/disable tiered, quick JIT) via runtime settings. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
